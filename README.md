This project is a simple Calculator  built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations directly from their browser.
## Features

- Responsive design with a visually appealing and user-friendly interface.

 Code Explanation

### HTML Structure
The calculator layout is implemented using a table to organize buttons and the display input field. The key elements include:

- Buttons created with input elements for interactivity.
- An input field with the ID `cal` to serve as the display for user inputs and results.

 CSS Styling
Custom styles are applied to ensure the interface is both functional and visually appealing:

- Buttons are styled with a black background and orange text for better contrast.
- The input field is styled for clear visibility of user inputs and results.

### JavaScript Functionality
The JavaScript code enables the core functionality of the calculator:

1. `display(x)` appends the clicked button's value to the input field.
2. `clearscreen()` clears all content from the input field.
3. `calculation()` evaluates the mathematical expression entered in the input field using the `eval()` function.

### Usage

1. Open the HTML file in a web browser.
2. Use the buttons to input numbers and operators.
3. Click "=" to calculate the result of the expression.
4. Use the "C" button to reset the input field for a new calculation.

## How to Run

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open the `index.html` file in any web browser.
3. Start using the calculator for basic arithmetic operations.
